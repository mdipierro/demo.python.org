Diversity Statement
===================

On October 12, 2009, the Board of the Python Software Foundation adopted
the following Diversity Statement:

    The Python Software Foundation and the global Python community
    welcome and encourage participation by everyone. Our community is
    based on mutual respect, tolerance, and encouragement, and we are
    working to help each other live up to these principles. We want
    our community to be more diverse: whoever you are, and whatever
    your background, we welcome you.

For additional resources on efforts to promote diversity within the
Python community, please see the
